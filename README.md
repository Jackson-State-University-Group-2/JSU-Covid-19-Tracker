# Covid Tracker Code
This branch is dedicated to our JSU Covid-19 exposure tracker. 
The purpose is to focus on activities involving people who may have been exposed to the virus, through close contact with a person diagnosed with COVID-19.
In this branch you can find the 5 different webpages (as of now) written in HTML & Java.
# DESCRIPTION
This web application will allow users to create an account with us and report when they have been diagnosed with Covid-19.
An email will be sent out to all users with information regarding the student's most frequent visits (Dorm Rooms).
